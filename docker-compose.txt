Step 1 — Installing Docker Compose
To make sure you obtain the most updated stable version of Docker Compose, you’ll download this software from its official Github repository.

First, confirm the latest version available in their releases page (https://github.com/docker/compose/releases). At the time of this writing, the most current stable version is 2.3.3.



Use the following command to download:

$> mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
$> curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose



Next, set the correct permissions so that the docker compose command is executable:

$> chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose


To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:

$> docker compose version
